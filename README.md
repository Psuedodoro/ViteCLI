# ViteCLI
> An NG cli alternative for making apps with ViteJS - containing the file structure influenced by Angular/NG-CLI, but improved for ViteJS and ReactJS as a whole by me (Psuedodoro)

## List of commands and what they do?
Before I tell you the commands, you have to know that this is not only in exprimental stage, but also the fact that I made this NPM-Package for myself, so if you want to use it - that is fine, but the features and command syntax in the CLI will be from what I want them to be - unless there are better commands suggested of course!

### **Command Prefix**
Currently, the command prefix is `vcli`. Therefore, if you were running the test command - you would write `vcli test`.

### **Now the good part (the commands and what they do!):**
- `init` / `i` : this outlines the folder structure for your project. E.g, in the src directory - it will add a pages folder, a components folder, and styling folder to get you started.
- `comp` / `c` : this makes a new component with all of the subfolders and files.
- `page` / `p` : makes a new "page" component in the pages directory.
- `test` / `t`: tests to see if the package is working. If it is, you will get a random, but nice text-art of the name of the project :)

## Bro, when JS support?
Sorry mate, but I don't personally think that writing JS - especially in scaling ReactJS/Vite-React apps are not the future. TypeScript solves a lot of problems that JS has in my opinion - and it does so very **very** well. Therefore, I will not add support for Vite-ReactJS apps, only Vite-ReactTS apps (created first with the `yarn create vite` command)

## How can I ask for more commands?
Easiest way to do so is to pop me a friend request on Discord, my username and handle is @Psuedodoro#2599. If that doesn't work, try @Psuedodoro#0001. Depends on whether I feel like paying for nitro ;)
